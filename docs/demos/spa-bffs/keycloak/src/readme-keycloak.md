# Configuring Keycloak

OidcProxy.Net only supports the Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Client Exchange (PKCE). That’s why it is important to configure Keycloak in a specific way.

Follow these steps to configure Keycloak correctly:

- Sign in to the Administration Console of your Keycloak instance.
- (Optional) In the realms drop-down (top left), create a new realm to hold the users etc. for your app.
- Select your new realm and click "Clients", then click "Create client".
- Provide a Client ID describing your app, and click "Next".

- In the "Capability config" panel, turn on “Client authentication” and ensure only “Standard flow” is selected. Click Next.

- In the "Login settings" panel, enter the BFF URLs as shown, then click "Save".

- Once the new client has been created, click on the Credentials tab. Ensure “Client Id and Secret” is selected as the Client Authenticator, and take a copy of the Client Secret. This and the Client ID will be needed for the spa+bff configuration.

- You can now set up one or more users within your Keycloak realm and/or configure an external Identity Provider if you have not done so already.

Proceed with the instructions described in [readme.md](readme.md).
